"1","The goal of the game is to complete 33 levels successfully.",,
"2","The board is 200 pixels wide horizontally and 300 pixels wide vertically.",,
"3","The bricks and the paddle are rectangular blocks with a width of 20 pixels and height of 10 pixels. The ball has a diameter of 10 pixels.",,
"4","At the beginning of each level, the ball starts from the top left corner of the board and moves downwards with a straight trajectory at a 45Â° angle and a speed of 5 pixels per second.",,
"5","At each level, the user moves a paddle in order to hit a ball, making the ball change its direction upward.",,
"6","To successfully complete a level, the user needs to break all bricks on the board by hitting them with the ball.",,
"7","Each brick must be either blue, red, or gold and is sized single or double.",,
"8","A brick is sized single (20 x 10 pixels) or double (40 x 10 pixels).",,
"9","Blue bricks are destroyed with one hit, red bricks require two hits, gold bricks require three hits.",,
"10","The first level gets initialised with 50 blue, single bricks randomly placed on the upper third of the board.",,
"11","The paddle only moves horizontally on the bottom of the board, controlled by the user by left and right arrow keys. The paddle always stays inside the board. When each level starts the paddle resets to the center of the bottom border.",,
"12","The ball direction changes every time the ball hits the paddle or the border of the board (except for the bottom border) or a brick, with the same angle of reflection as the angle of incidence.",,
"13","Every time the next level starts, the speed of the ball increases by 1 pixel per second.",,
"14","When the user finishes a level, the next level with a different brick arrangement and increased difficulty begins. Each level adds two red bricks and one gold brick.",,
"15","The program shall generate the sizes of the new level's bricks (single or double) and the brick arrangement (where in the upper third of the board the bricks will spawn) randomly.",,
"16","The user has 3 lives.",,
"17","The user loses a life every time the ball falls off the bottom of the board.",,
"18","When the user loses a life but still has lives remaining, the level restarts. Once the user loses all lives, the game is over.",,
